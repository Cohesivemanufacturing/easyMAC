 easyMAC NC interpreter codes

 Type '$' before the NC command to access the RS-274 interpreter (e.g '$N01 G10 X10 F200').
 Codes are display according to the order of execution

 N_             		    | set sequence number
 G93            		    | set feed mode to inverse time
 G94            		    | set feed mode to units per minuite
 G95            		    | set feed mode to units per revolution
 F_             		    | set feed rate in units/min
 G04            		    | dwell
 G17            		    | set plane to XY
 G18            	            | set plane to ZX
 G19            		    | set plane to YZ
 G20            		    | set length units to IN
 G21            		    | set length units to MM
 G40            		    | disable radius compensation
 G41    	       		    | set radius compensation to tool left
 G42            	            | set radius compensation to tool right
 G43    	       	            | enable length compensation
 G49    	                    | disable length compensation
 G54 - G59         		    | set coordinate system
 G90               		    | set distance mode to absolute
 G91               		    | set distance mode to relative
 G92 X_ Y_ Z_      		    | set origin offset to X_ Y_ Z
 G92               		    | calulates the origin offsets that make the actual position X0 Y0 Z0
 G00               		    | set motion mode rapid
 G00 X_ Y_ Z_       		    | move rapid to X_ Y_ Z_ 
 G01               		    | set motion mode to linear
 G01 X_ Y_ Z_ F_    		    | move linear to X_ Y_ Z_ at feed F 
 G02               		    | set motion mode to multi-quadrant cw circular
 G02 X/Z/Y_ Y/X/Z_ I/K/J_ J/I/K_ F_ | move cw circular to X_ Y_ Z_ with center I/K/J_ J/I/K_ feed F 
 G03 X/Z/Y_ Y/X/Z_ I/K/J_ J/I/K_ F_ | move ccw circular to X_ Y_ Z_ with center I/K/J_ J/I/K_ feed F
