Cloud NC

EasyMAC-executive has a simulator with the NC kernel of a virtual 3-axis milling machine 
and a native adapter to OSCM client. This functionality allows easyMAC to connect to OSCM 
client and transmit streams of simulated-machine data to the cloud. The virtual machine 
controller can be configured to different interpreter, interpolation, and servo parameters 
by modifying the entries in the file:

.\executive\winX86\res\executive\config\easyMAC.ini

Alternatively, the controller parameters can be configured with easyMAC console commands. 
(
 see console commands:
 > help 
 > help start
) 

The cloudnc thread can be started with console command:

> set cloudnc enable

Example 1. Start the cloudnc simulation threat and manually move the virtual machine

> set cloudnc enable     // starts the cloudnc tread and the console with output compiled motion
> set program test10.nc  // starts the program: .\executive\winX86\res\interpreter\programs\test10.nc   
> $G01 X10 F400          // move the virtual machine 10 units in the X-direction at a feed of 400 units/min

Example 2. Start cloudnc simulation threat and run a sample NC program

> set cloudnc enable     // starts the cloudnc tread and the console with output compiled motion
> set program test10.nc  // starts the program: .\executive\winX86\res\interpreter\programs\test10.nc             
> set program pause      // pauses program execution
> set program continue   // continues program execution
> set program stop       // stops program execution

Example 3. Start cloudnc simulation thread, run a sample NC program and 
connect with OSCM client.

This example requires you to have:
1. registered a resource in OSCM 
2. download OSCM client. 
2. generated the resource configuration and pasted it to:adapters_root_directory/adapter/res/config

in the easyMAC console:

> set cloudnc enable     // starts the cloudnc tread and the console with output compiled motion
> set program test10.nc  // starts the program: .\executive\winX86\res\interpreter\programs\test10.nc 

start OSCM client and use your user credentials to connect the simulation stream to you resource!
