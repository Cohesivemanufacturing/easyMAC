ToDo

1. initialization protocol for the interpolator
2. initialization protocol for the axis
3. homming and G53 seeting
4. soft resetting of the program; tight to the problem of stoping/pausing 
   the interpolators

Current issues

1. problems at the moment of interpolating test9.nc
2. There is not a way from pausing and stoping the interpolator in the
   middle an interpolating job
